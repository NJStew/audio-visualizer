## Road Map:
- Update weather conditions every set amount of time
- Add support for custom screen dimensions
- Add Google Calendar API to display upcoming events
- Add ability to switch between default microphone and internal sound being played on the device
- Add ability to customize dashboard colors
- Export project into standalone application
